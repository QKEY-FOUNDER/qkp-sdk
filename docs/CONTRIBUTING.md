# CONTRIBUTING — QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)

This document defines how individuals and organizations can contribute to the QuantumKey Protocol in a structured, accountable, and verifiable way.

Contribution to QKP is not only about code.
It is about **intent, responsibility, and traceable impact**.

---

## Purpose

QuantumKey Protocol is designed to be extended by humans and intelligent systems without compromising semantic integrity, accountability, or trust separation.

This contributor model exists to ensure that:

- Contributions are intentional and traceable
- Responsibility is explicit
- Quality is enforced structurally, not socially
- Governance can emerge without centralization

---

## Contribution Principles

All contributions to QKP MUST respect the following principles:

- **Verifiability over authority**
- **Structure over interpretation**
- **Cryptography before policy**
- **Explicit intent over implicit behavior**
- **Accountability without gatekeeping**

If a contribution cannot be verified, reviewed, or attributed, it does not belong in QKP.

---

## Contributor Roles

QKP defines contribution roles by **type of intent**, not status.

### 1. Reader

Anyone who explores, studies, or evaluates QKP.

Readers may:
- Run reference flows
- Review specifications
- Open discussions or questions
- Suggest clarifications

No approval required.

---

### 2. Contributor

Contributors propose changes or additions.

This includes:
- Code (protocol, SDK, examples)
- Specifications
- Documentation
- Tests and conformance cases
- Tooling or integrations

Contributors MUST:
- Open a pull request
- Clearly describe intent and scope
- Reference affected files or concepts
- Accept that contributions are reviewed, modified, or rejected

---

### 3. Maintainer

Maintainers are trusted to merge contributions.

Their responsibility is to:
- Preserve protocol integrity
- Enforce canonical definitions
- Ensure conformance coverage
- Reject changes that weaken accountability or semantics

Maintainers do not own the protocol.
They steward its structure.

---

### 4. Steward (Future Role)

Stewards are long-term custodians of the protocol’s direction.

This role is expected to emerge through:
- Proven contributions
- Community trust
- Transparent governance processes

Stewardship is not assigned.
It is earned and recorded.

---

## Contribution Types

### Code Contributions

All code contributions MUST:
- Be deterministic
- Avoid hidden state
- Follow existing canonical patterns
- Include or update conformance tests when applicable

Breaking changes are not accepted outside explicit version upgrades.

---

### Specification Contributions

Specification changes MUST:
- Be explicit and minimal
- Preserve backward compatibility where possible
- Be reflected in conformance tests
- Avoid ambiguity or informal language

If a rule matters, it must be specifiable.

---

### Documentation Contributions

Documentation should:
- Explain intent, not just usage
- Reflect actual behavior
- Avoid marketing language
- Remain consistent with protocol reality

---

## Review Process

Every contribution follows the same process:

1. Proposal via pull request
2. Technical and semantic review
3. Conformance impact assessment
4. Merge, request changes, or rejection

Decisions are based on:
- Structural correctness
- Verifiability
- Alignment with protocol principles

Not on popularity or authority.

---

## What QKP Does Not Accept

The following are explicitly rejected:

- Undocumented behavior
- Implicit trust assumptions
- Centralized control mechanisms
- Hidden permissions or shortcuts
- Non-deterministic logic
- Speculative or financial hype

QKP is infrastructure, not narrative.

---

## Responsibility and Attribution

All contributions are attributable via Git history.

There is:
- No anonymous merge
- No silent modification
- No retroactive rewriting

Accountability applies to contributors and maintainers alike.

---

## Code of Conduct

QKP enforces a simple rule:

> Disagree structurally, not personally.

Critique ideas.
Challenge assumptions.
Respect contributors.

Abuse, coercion, or manipulation are incompatible with this project.

---

## Getting Started

If this is your first contribution:

1. Read `docs/START_HERE.md`
2. Run `examples/reference-flow.js`
3. Review `docs/protocol-spec.md`
4. Inspect `docs/conformance.md`
5. Open a small, focused pull request

Start with clarity.
Scale with evidence.

---

## Final Note

QuantumKey Protocol is not owned by any individual.
It is shaped by accountable contributions.

If you contribute, you become part of the protocol’s history — verifiably.

Welcome.
