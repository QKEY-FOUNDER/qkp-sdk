# QuantumKey Protocol — Launch Readiness & Stewardship Operations

**Protocol Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Launch-Ready  
**Repository:** qkp-sdk  
**Date:** 2025

---

## Purpose

This document declares the operational readiness of the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) following the v1.0 protocol freeze.

Launch readiness does not imply marketing, adoption, or growth commitments.  
It declares that the protocol is **stable, usable, and stewarded**.

---

## Launch Readiness Criteria

QKP is considered launch-ready when the following conditions are met:

- Core protocol semantics are frozen (v1.0)
- Conformance cases C1–C20 are passing
- Reference implementation is complete
- Executable reference flow is available
- Governance and stewardship rules are documented
- Versioning and evolution rules are explicit

All criteria above are satisfied at the time of this declaration.

---

## Operational Scope

After launch readiness:

- QKP MAY be used in production or experimental systems
- QKP MAY be evaluated by third parties
- QKP MAY be forked or extended under versioning rules

Launch readiness does NOT imply:
- Central support guarantees
- Operational SLAs
- Security warranties beyond protocol design
- Endorsement of specific deployments

---

## Stewardship Operations

Stewardship after launch is governed by:

- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/GOVERNANCE_SNAPSHOT_v1.0.md`
- `docs/VERSIONING.md`

Operational stewardship focuses on:

- Reviewing contributions
- Preserving protocol invariants
- Enforcing conformance
- Documenting decisions
- Rotating stewardship roles

There is no permanent operations team.

---

## Incident Handling

QKP does not provide centralized incident response.

In case of issues:

- Bugs are reported via issues or pull requests
- Fixes follow the contribution lifecycle
- Protocol-breaking issues require a major version process
- Incidents are documented transparently

Operational failures do not rewrite protocol history.

---

## Communication Boundaries

After launch readiness:

- Public communication MUST reference canonical documents
- Claims MUST be verifiable against specification and conformance
- No individual may speak “on behalf of the protocol” beyond evidence

Authority derives from artifacts, not representation.

---

## Statement

With this document, QuantumKey Protocol v1.0 is declared **launch-ready**.

From this point forward, QKP exists as a **stable, referenceable, and stewarded protocol**, suitable for real-world evaluation and use.

---

Launch does not mark an end.

It marks the point at which accountability becomes continuous.
