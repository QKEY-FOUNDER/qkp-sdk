# QuantumKey Protocol — Canonical Public Statement

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is a protocol for **verifiable accountability** across autonomous and federated systems.

QKP replaces implicit trust assumptions with **cryptographic evidence**, making intent, execution, aggregation, and trust decisions explicit, auditable, and replayable over time.

Instead of asking *who* to trust, QKP enables any verifier to determine:

- What was intended
- Who declared it
- What was authorized
- What actually happened
- Under which rules it was accepted or rejected

All as canonical, signed, and verifiable artifacts.

QKP separates:
- Cryptographic validity (what is true)
- Causality (how actions are related)
- Trust (whether results are accepted)
- Attestation (who accepts or rejects)

This separation allows accountability to scale across:
- Autonomous agents
- Federated systems
- Organizations and jurisdictions
- Long-lived and evolving environments

QKP is not a blockchain, not a governance ideology, and not a trust authority.

It is a **foundational protocol layer** that enables accountable coordination without centralization, surveillance, or implicit assumptions.

With the v1.0 freeze, QKP is formally defined, auditable, and referenceable.

Trust is no longer implicit.  
It is preserved through structure.
