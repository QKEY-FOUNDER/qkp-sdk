# QuantumKey Protocol — Governance Snapshot v1.0

**Status:** Recorded  
**Protocol Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** 2025  
**Repository:** qkp-sdk

---

## Purpose

This document records the **governance state of the QuantumKey Protocol at the moment of the v1.0 freeze**.

It does not grant authority.
It documents responsibility.

This snapshot exists so future contributors, auditors, and integrators can verify:
- Who could influence the protocol
- Under which rules
- With what limits
- At what point in time

---

## Governance Model (v1.0)

QuantumKey Protocol governance is defined by the following principles:

- No centralized authority
- No permanent maintainers
- No implicit decision power
- No governance by ownership or capital

All influence is:
- Intent-driven
- Evidence-based
- Time-bound
- Auditable

---

## Roles at v1.0

### 1. Protocol Author

- **Name:** Mihail Chiosa
- **Role:** Original protocol author
- **Authority:** None beyond authorship
- **Special powers:** None

Authorship does not imply control.

---

### 2. Maintainers

At the time of v1.0 freeze:

- Maintainers act as **stewards**, not owners
- Stewardship is:
  - Non-exclusive
  - Revocable
  - Recorded through contribution history

There is no permanent maintainer role.

---

### 3. Contributors

Anyone may contribute via:

- Code
- Specification text
- Documentation
- Test cases
- Reference flows

Acceptance depends on:
- Verifiability
- Consistency with frozen protocol semantics
- Review and evidence

---

## Decision Boundaries

In v1.0, the following boundaries apply:

- ❌ No one may change frozen protocol semantics
- ❌ No one may bypass conformance requirements
- ❌ No one may redefine canonical structures

- ✅ Anyone may propose improvements
- ✅ Anyone may review and challenge proposals
- ✅ Anyone may fork the protocol

Forking is considered a valid governance outcome.

---

## Conflict Resolution

QKP does not resolve disputes internally.

Instead:
- Disagreements are recorded
- Alternatives may coexist
- Evidence remains verifiable

Consensus is social.
The protocol remains neutral.

---

## Relationship to Conformance

Governance decisions do not override:

- Cryptographic validity
- Causal structure
- Conformance cases C1–C20

If governance conflicts with protocol truth, **protocol truth prevails**.

---

## Snapshot Statement

This document represents the **complete governance snapshot of QuantumKey Protocol v1.0**.

Any future governance change MUST:
- Reference this snapshot
- Declare what changed
- Declare why
- Declare under which version

---

**Governance is not power.  
It is responsibility recorded in time.**
